/**
io_uring_enter() is used to initiate and complete I/O using the shared submission and completion queues setup by a cal
l to io_uring_setup(2). A single call can both submit new I/O and wait for completions of I/O initiated by this call or
previous calls to io_uring_enter().

fd is the file descriptor returned by io_uring_setup(2). to_submit specifies the number of I/Os to submit from the
submission queue. flags is a bitmask of the following values:

IORING_ENTER_GETEVENTS
If this flag is set, then the system call will wait for the specificied number of events in min_complete before
returning. This flag can be set along with to_submit to both submit and complete events in a single system call.

IORING_ENTER_SQ_WAKEUP
If the ring has been created with IORING_SETUP_SQPOLL, then this flag asks the kernel to wakeup the SQ kernel thread
to submit IO.

IORING_ENTER_SQ_WAIT
If the ring has been created with IORING_SETUP_SQPOLL, then the application has no real insight into when the SQ kernel
thread has consumed entries from the SQ ring. This can lead to a situation where the application can no longer get a
free SQE entry to submit, without knowing when it one becomes available as the SQ kernel thread consumes them. If the
system call is used with this flag set, then it will wait until at least one entry is free in the SQ ring.

If the io_uring instance was configured for polling, by specifying IORING_SETUP_IOPOLL in the call to io_uring_setup(2),
then min_complete has a slightly different meaning.  Passing a value of 0 instructs the kernel to return any events
which are already complete, without blocking.  If min_complete is a non-zero value, the kernel will still return
immediately if any completion events are available.  If no event completions are available, then the call will poll
either until one or more completions become available, or until the process has exceeded its scheduler time slice.

Note that, for interrupt driven I/O (where IORING_SETUP_IOPOLL was not specified in the call to io_uring_setup(2)),
an application may check the completion queue for event completions without entering the kernel at all.

When the system call returns that a certain amount of SQEs have been consumed and submitted, it's safe to reuse SQE
entries in the ring. This is true even if the actual IO submission had to be punted to async context, which means
that the SQE may in fact not have been submitted yet. If the kernel requires later use of a particular SQE entry, it
will have made a private copy of it.

sig is a pointer to a signal mask (see sigprocmask(2)); if sig is not NULL, io_uring_enter() first replaces the current
signal mask by the one pointed to by sig, then waits for events to become available in the completion queue, and then
restores the original signal mask.  The following io_uring_enter() call:

```
ret = io_uring_enter(fd, 0, 1, IORING_ENTER_GETEVENTS, &sig);
```

is equivalent to atomically executing the following calls:

```C
pthread_sigmask(SIG_SETMASK, &sig, &orig);
ret = io_uring_enter(fd, 0, 1, IORING_ENTER_GETEVENTS, NULL);
pthread_sigmask(SIG_SETMASK, &orig, NULL);
```
See the description of pselect(2) for an explanation of why the sig parameter is necessary.

Submission queue entries are represented using the following data structure:

```C
/*
 * IO submission data structure (Submission Queue Entry)
*/
struct io_uring_sqe {
__u8    opcode;         /* type of operation for this sqe */
