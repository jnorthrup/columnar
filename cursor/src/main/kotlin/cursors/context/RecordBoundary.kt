/**
 * context-level support class for Fixed or Tokenized Record boundary conditions.
 *
 *
 * This does not extend guarantees to cell-level definitions--
 * FWF cells are parsed strings, thus tokenized within fixed records, and may carry lineendings
 * csv records with fixed length fields is rare but has its place in aged messaging formats.
 * even fixed-record fixed-cell (e.g. purer ISAM) formats have to use external size variables for varchar
 *
 * it is assumed that record-level granularity and above are efficiently held in context details to perform outer loops
 * once the context variables are activated and conjoined per thier roles.
