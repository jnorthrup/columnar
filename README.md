## signal pattern recognition and encoding gateway for higher level languages   

This project is to test the premise of programming in higher dimensions using dimensionally reduced transmission
techniques to indicate program state, instructions, instruction effects, object mutation and lifecycle.

For a given program, we typically have a language, parameters, instructions, datatypes, and well defined finite 
execution properties forming the basis for a thing humans run on computers to perform work.

it is my hope to express these factors in terms of pushing a hypothetical marble through space and declaring a 
program's state as a collection of trajectories signaled by positive energy changes to a signal, and describe 
instructions and instruction effects signalled by negative energy along the same dimension--  such as a plane or 
angular surface(s) that change the properties and manifestation of state along consistent proportional vectors to 
original imperative code.

# sample usecases

## binary encoding

simplest possible encoding an xy-plot to binary.

find repeating coefficients which can express data losslessly as DCT-like curves
